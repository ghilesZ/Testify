# Testify
Testify is a syntactic extension that features type driven code
generation to automatically generate test for your programs. It allows
you to attach a property to a given type, as in the following example:

```OCaml
type p_int = int [@satisfying (fun x -> x > 0)]
```

Which is to be understood as the type of *positive integers*. Of
course, OCaml's type system cannot type-check this kind of property,
however we can test them!  Testify then uses the explicit type
annotations of your program to generate tests for the values whose
return type is ```p_int```, as in the following example.

```OCaml
let abs (x:int) : p_int = if x < 0 then -x else x
```
is now rewritten into:

```OCaml
let abs (x:int) : p_int = if x < 0 then -x else x

let _ = QCheck.Test.make (QCheck.make QCheck.Gen.int) (fun x1 -> ((<) 0) (abs x1))
```

As you noticed, a test has been added after the declaration of
```abs``` to check that its return values are indeed positive
integers. As you also noticed, Testify uses the wonderful QCheck
library do the tests.

## How is it done?
Testifies features an automatic derivation of QCheckâ€™s generators for
[most](#Generator derivation)   basic types and uses those to randomly generates inputs for each
function whose return type was attached a generator.  It then applies
the function to the obtained inputs and checks the ouput against the
specified property.

### Generator derivation
- for basic types (unit, bool, char, int, float)
- for tuples
- for types who are attached a predicate, we proceed to a rejection
  sampling using ```QCheck.find_example```. However, this can be
  avoided by specifying a generator to the given type **t** using the
  ```[@gen t]``` annotation.
