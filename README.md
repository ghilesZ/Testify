# Testify
Testify is a syntactic extension that features type driven code
generation to automatically generate test for your programs. It
allows you to attach a property to a given type **t** and use the explicit
type annotations of your program to generate tests for the values whose 
return type is  **t**,  as in the following example.

```OCaml
type itv = int * int [@satisfying (fun (x,y) -> x <= y)]

let neg ((low,high):itv) : itv = -high,-low

let add ((low1,high1):itv) ((low2,high2):itv) : itv =
  (low1 + low2), (high1 + high2)
```

which is rewritten into:


```OCaml
type itv = (((int * int))[@satisfying fun (x, y) -> x <= y])

let neg ((low, high) : itv) = (((- high), (- low)) : itv)

(QCheck.Test.make ~count:1000
        ~name:"neg does not respect the prediate (fun (x, y) -> x <= y) for some input"
        (QCheck.make
           (QCheck.find_example ~f:(fun (x, y) -> x <= y)
              (QCheck.Gen.pair QCheck.Gen.int QCheck.Gen.int)))
        (fun x1 -> (fun (x, y) -> x <= y) (neg x1)))
        
let add ((low1, high1) : itv) ((low2, high2) : itv) =
  (((low1 + low2), (high1 + high2)) : itv)
  
let _ = 
    (QCheck.Test.make ~count:1000
        ~name:"add does not respect the prediate (fun (x, y) -> x <= y) for some input"
        (QCheck.make
           (QCheck.Gen.pair
              (QCheck.find_example ~f:(fun (x, y) -> x <= y)
                 (QCheck.Gen.pair QCheck.Gen.int QCheck.Gen.int))
              (QCheck.find_example ~f:(fun (x, y) -> x <= y)
                 (QCheck.Gen.pair QCheck.Gen.int QCheck.Gen.int))))
        (fun (x1, x2) -> (fun (x, y) -> x <= y) (add x1 x2)))
```

As you noticed, Testify uses the wonderful QCheck library do the
tests.

## How is it done?
Testifies features an automatic derivation of QCheckâ€™s generators for
most basic types and uses those to randomly generates inputs for each
function whose return type was attached a generator.  It the applies
the function to the obtained inputs and checks the ouput against the
specified property.

### Generator derivation
- for basic types (unit, bool, char, int, float)
- for tuples
- for types who are attached a predicate, we proceed to a rejection
  sampling using ```QCheck.find_example```. However, this can be
  avoided by specifying a generator to the given type **t** using the
  ```[@gen t]``` annotation.
