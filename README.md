Testify
Testify is a syntactic extension that features type driven code
generation to automatically generate test for your programs. It
allows you to attach a property to a given type t and use the explicit
type annotations of your program to generate tests for the values of type t, as in the following example.

type itv = int * int [@satisfying (fun (x,y) -> x <= y)]

let add (i1:itv) (i2:itv) : itv =
  ((fst i1) + (fst i2)), ((snd i1) + (snd i2))
which is rewritten into:

type itv = int * int [@satisfying (fun (x,y) -> x <= y)]

let add (i1:itv) (i2:itv) : itv =
  ((fst i1) + (fst i2)), ((snd i1) + (snd i2))

let _ =
    let open QCheck in
    Test.make ~count:1000
              ~name:"Test : add according to fun (x, y) -> x <= y"
              (QCheck.make
                (QCheck.Gen.pair
                  (QCheck.find_example ~f:(fun (x, y) -> x <= y)
                                       (QCheck.Gen.pair QCheck.Gen.int QCheck.Gen.int))
                  (QCheck.find_example ~f:(fun (x, y) -> x <= y)
                                       (QCheck.Gen.pair QCheck.Gen.int QCheck.Gen.int))))
               (fun (x1, x2) -> (fun (x, y) -> x <= y) (add x1 x2))

As you noticed, Testify uses the wonderful QCheck library as a testing
framework.

How is it done?
Testifies features an automatic derivation of QCheckâ€™s generators for most basic types and uses those to randomly generates inputs for each function whose return type was attached a generator.
